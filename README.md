NIST SP 800-37 - [Risk Management Framework for Systems and Organizations Introductory Course Version 2.0](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KQWZC2f4_7msxc-vHTzGN8Xa3GYFDykH/view?usp=sharing)<br />
+ An [overview](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/risk-management/images-media/rmf-training/intro-course-v2_0/index.html) of a methodology for organizational security and privacy risk management developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  The purpose of this course is to provide people new to risk management with an overview of a methodology for managing organizational risk in accordance with NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-37, Revision 2.  For individuals with experience with NIST SP 800-37, Revision 1, this course explains updates to the RMF in Revision 2, including the integration of privacy and supply chain risk management into this holistic process.  The RMF provides a disciplined, structured, and flexible process for managing security and privacy risk that includes information security categorization; control selection, implementation, and assessment; system and common control authorizations; and continuous monitoring.  This course describes, at a high-level, the importance of establishing an organization-wide risk management program, the information security legislation related to organizational risk management, the steps in the RMF, and the NIST publications related to each step. 

NIST SP 800-53 - [Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations Introductory Course](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zLdLS09A1UWnvQvgB-Cj1NkS_exAZ7Jz/view?usp=sharing)<br />
+ An [overview](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Projects/risk-management/images-media/rmf-training/53-intro-course-v1/index.html) of the catalog of security and privacy controls developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  NIST SP 800-53 provides a comprehensive catalog of outcome-based security and privacy controls.  The controls can be implemented in organizations of all types and sizes, as well as any type of system.  The controls provide the safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and available of the systems and information, and manage privacy risks.  This course introduces the structure and organization of the security and privacy controls in Revision 5 of the catalog.  It also describes key considerations for the implementation of controls as part of an organization-wide risk management program.

NIST SP 800-53A - [Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Information Systems and Organizations Introductory Course](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11tBysQyRbfDlYamlLq9051cmeqpStF_h/view?usp=sharing)<br />
+ An [overview](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Projects/risk-management/images-media/rmf-training/53A-intro-course-v1/index.html) of a framework for assessing security and privacy controls developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  NIST SP 800-53A introduces a control assessment methodology and set of assessment procedures for the SP 800-53 controls.  Control assessments are critical for understanding the overall effectiveness of implemented controls, and is essential in determining risk.  This course introduces the structure and organization of the Revision 5 assessment procedures. It also describes a methodology to build and tailor effective assessment plans and how to report, analyze, and manage assessment results as part of an organization-wide risk management program.

NIST SP 800-53B - [Control Baselines for Information Systems and Organizations Introductory Course](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r2I56MqfApQhOTtRkTce__6f1q0IvXsr/view?usp=sharing)<br />
+ An [overview](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Projects/risk-management/images-media/rmf-training/53B-intro-course-v1/index.html) of security and privacy control baselines for organizational risk management developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  NOTE: NIST SP 800-53B establishes security and privacy control baselines for systems and organizations, and it provides tailoring guidance for those baselines. The security and privacy control baselines were developed specifically for federal systems but can serve as a starting point for any organization. Control baselines are collection of controls from SP 800-53 assembled to address specific protection needs for the low-impact, moderate-impact, high-impact systems, and meet privacy program requirements under Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130. This course introduces the structure and organization of the SP 800-53B security and privacy control baselines, and guidance on tailoring and development of control overlays to facilitate control baseline customization for specific communities of interest, technologies, and environments of operation. Also Note: The NIST SP 800-53B is a companion document to NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5.
